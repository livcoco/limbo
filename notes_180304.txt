4/4/18 Notes - Stuart Nelson, James Waldby
NixNote2 looks like a good start.  I has a lot of what we want.  Unfortunately it is written in C++, which will make it hard
to integrate with Kodi and harder to work on.  The user interface looks like it has most of what we need. Looked for a python
version, but didn't find one.  There is a python sdk for talking to evernote, but no app.

System Use Case:  
  When a note is created related to some media, picture, movie, etc. auto tags are assigned and user defined tags
  The media referenced by the note can then be displayed based on the tags of the note.
  This allows making notes about all your pictures, then sorting the pictures based on the tags of the notes

Python based note apps in github:
  A simple note taking web app
  Tnote
  SublimeNotebook
  
Also Xnote plugin exists for Kodi, but does not seem to be functional
