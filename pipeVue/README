The pipeVue program allows easy drawing of "posts and pipes" figures.
It interprets drawing-scripts for figures, and produces files of
OpenSCAD code representing the figures.

Figures to be drawn are made up of cylinders (pipes) connected between
locations in space (posts).  This paradigm is useful for drawing
diagrams of geodesic domes.

To use the program, you need to have python3 and OpenSCAD installed on
your system.  [Early versions of pipeVue also required the
`SolidPython` module, but current versions do not.]

Obtain files pipeVue.py, pipeVue.codeBase.scad, and a script file for
the drawing you wish to make.  For script-file examples, see the files
in the pipeVue directory whose names start with "eg-".  For details
about how to write scripts, see the LibreOffice file pipeVue.dox.odt .

When you run the program to process a script, it will write SCAD code
to a file (by default, to pipeVue.scad). For example, you might say

     ./pipeVue.py  f=eg-pentagon-script

which will produce pipeVue.scad based on that script, and then you
might say

     openscad pipeVue.scad &

which will cause OpenSCAD to read pipeVue.scad and display the created
figure.

If OpenSCAD's `Design -> Automatic Reload and Preview` option is on,
then once you've started OpenSCAD as above, it will notice whenever
pipeVue.scad changes, and will re-render the image.  See other
comments (about running the program) at beginning of pipeVue.py.  For
example, using exec-on-change as obtained at
https://github.com/ghjwp7/plastics/blob/master/exec-on-change, you can
have pipeVue run automatically whenever you change a script file,
after which in its turn OpenSCAD will automatically update the
display.
