An example file to demonstrate automatically making edges (cylinders)
between posts that are within specified cutoff distance of each other.

Note: In this example, generated points may superficially resemble a
geodesic arrangement.  However, the arbitrarily selected radii and z
values used don't give a real geodesic arrangement.  jiw 17 Feb 2020

pipeVue's automatic-edge algorithm is simple-minded.  It merely
generates all edges of lengths up to a cutoff limit, autoMax.  If
autoMax is overly large, edges may be generated that are not part of a
valid triangulation.

zSpread=t turns on a conformal transform to give triangles on the
outskirts of a hemisphere more screen area, for easier viewing.  It
maps point (x,y,z) to (c*x,c*y,z) where c = 2/(1+z/zSize).  This can
broaden or flatten the sides of the hemisphere, displaying like a cone
with a rounded top.  Larger zSize decreases the broadening effect.
Here, with zSize=6, the outer polygons are narrower than if zSize were
equal to the radius 4.

Other parameters: autoList=f says don't list auto-edges.  autoList=t
would list them.  autoMax is the maximum length generated edges can
have.  autoMax default value is 0, for no edge generation.
postAxial=f makes the posts point at OP. OP is given by O entry in the
layout section.  postLabel=cMu makes labels at level c, magenta, size u.
