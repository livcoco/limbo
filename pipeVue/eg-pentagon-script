eg-pentagon-script --

An example with a set of pentagons for the
grid of points, and some connecting-up cylinders.  The C 0,0,0;
entry makes a center post.  The P5 entries make three regular
pentagons, of radii 1, 1.6, and 2, with the middle pentagon rotated
36 degrees to place its vertices on lines midway between vertices
of the other pentagons.  Thus, a total of 16 points.

In an =L or =C line, only the first two characters (=L or =C) matter.
In an =P line, the rest of the line should contain var=value pairs.
Note, =P lines can be intermixed within other sections, and are treated
in the order that they appear.
