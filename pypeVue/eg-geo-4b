This script is a bit of testing for G & H layout codes, which are used
for making geodesic dome layouts.  Also demos D and E codes.  D
followed by a list of post numbers deletes those posts and renumbers
other posts and cylinders accordingly.  E followed by a list of pairs
of numbers deletes any cylinder that corresponds to a pair.  Note,
doing E before D uses original post numbers; doing E after D uses new
(renumbered) post numbers.

=  Set clip box to take away 3 posts, leaving a door opening.
=  7 Mar glitch: clip box nonintuitively applies before standard rotation of 58,-18

=  Remove an = in =P line, and add one in =L D line, if you
=  want to see original numbers before post deletions.
