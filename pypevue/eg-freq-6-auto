An example file to demonstrate automatically making edges (cylinders)
between posts that are within specified cutoff distance of each other.

Note: In this example, generated points superficially resemble a
geodesic arrangement.  However, the arbitrarily selected radii and z
values used don't give a real geodesic arrangement.  jiw 15 Feb 2020

In this example, no edges are specified in the =C section, so all
edges are auto-generated, with lengths up to a cutoff value, autoMax.
If you specify autoMax=126 (here or on the command line) instead of
127 you will see ten edges disappear (not be generated) in the outer
ring of triangles.

The next several ranks of post separations after 127 in this example
occur just below 131, 139, 140, 142, 153... units of length.  For this
example, autoMax values slightly below those values give different
numbers of edges generated than at those values.  For example,
autoMax=138 makes 205 edges and autoMax=139 makes 210 edges, with both
cases having obviously invalid triangulations.
  
In the parameter section, autoList controls whether automatically-
generated edges get listed, and autoMax is the maximum length that
generated edges can have.  (If autoMax is 0 or less, no edges can be
generated.  Its default value is 0.)  Notes: postAxial=f makes the
posts point at OP, and postLabel=cMu gives labels that are magenta,
size u, level c.  To see a list of auto-edges, change autoList=f to
autoList=t.
