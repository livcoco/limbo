Notes about geodesic outputs that are striking or interesting

------------------------------------------------
With wide thin posts, an effect like an inner dome occurs.
Picture: geo-freq6-all1c.png
Eg:  
    yAngle, zAngle = asin(phi/r)*180/pi, -18 # ~ 58.2825, -18
    Vfreq=6
    clipLo = Point(-2,-2,-0.01)
    clipHi = Point(2,2,2)
./makeIcosaGeo.py > t1-v && ./pypeVue.py f=t1-v  postLabel=f  pDiam=.07 postHi=.01 postDiam=.35

The post diameter above is slightly more than pentagon diameter, and
slightly less than hexagon diameter.  Also, cylinders are thick, so
most of the edges of posts are covered by them.

------------------------------------------------

For a sort of trefoil effect:
./pypeVue.py f=eg-geo-6a geoColors=YCCC pDiam=0.05
where eg-geo-6a contains an =L G 9 1; code

------------------------------------------------

Color translation: Parameter geoColors is a four-character string that
specifies which colors to use for certain classes of cylinders (edges
in the geodesic arrangement).  The classes will be called Pentagons,
Rings, Rays, and Seams.*  The four color-letters in the geoColors
parameter should have legitimate pypeVue color codes to use for
Pentagons, Rings, Rays, and Seams, in that order.  Example: The
default value, geoColors=YBRC, colors Pentagons yellow, Rings blue,
Rays red, and Seams cyan.  Example: geoColors=YCCC colors Pentagons
yellow, and all other edges cyan.

To see the latter example:
    ./pypeVue.py f=eg-geo-6a geoColors=YCCC

To see yellow, cyan, purple, coral:
    ./pypeVue.py f=eg-geo-6a geoColors=YCPA pDiam=0.05

*Generally, "Pentagon" refers to the spokes of small pentagons, and
also refers to the outer edges of the top central small pentagon.
"Ring" refers to sets of basically-horizontal edges, eg the equator.
"Rays" are non-Ring sides of hexagons.  "Seams" are edges where
icosahedron faces meet.  (At present [6 March] code for detecting
which class an edge is in does not correctly classify outer edges of
most small pentagons.)
